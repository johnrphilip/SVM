# Executive Summary

This project aims to analyze the impact of renewable energy usage on CO2 emissions in the UK. Utilizing datasets from the Office of National Statistics and the Global Carbon Project, we've built a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict CO2 emissions based on various energy sources. The model employs optimization techniques like Tabu Search and Greedy Search for feature selection and is validated through metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## What I Learned & Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling different units, managing missing data, and nominal attributes.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilizing statistical and visual methods to understand the essence of the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Developed a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model for prediction.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Employed Tabu Search and Greedy Search for feature selection.
