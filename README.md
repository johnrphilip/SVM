# Support Vector Machine for Predicting Energy Consumption

## Executive Summary

- **Objective**: To predict the impact of renewable energy usage on the UK's carbon emissions using a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.
- **Methodology**: Utilized datasets from the Global Carbon Project and the Office of National Statistics. Employed tabu search and greedy search for feature selection optimization.
- **Results**: Achieved high R-squared and low Mean Squared Error (MSE) values, proving the model's effectiveness.
- **Limitations**: Did not account for all influencing variables like economic growth, energy type, and government policies.
- **Implication**: Provides valuable insights for policymakers and businesses in the renewable energy sector.
